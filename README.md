Message from the author:

"When I started to work from home I encountered a situation where I needed to go away from the desk or simply read an article for a long time without any interaction with my computer

Unfortunately, the status on the team's chat changed to inactive after a minute of not touching a mouse. That was really annoying and I wasn't feeling okay to take a break with Away status.

Or even worst my PC started to log off and I had to enter the password again.
So I decided to create software to simulate real mouse movements. Today I am happy to share it with you for free.

Don't worry anymore about your computer logging off or status changing. Stay always Online! "
